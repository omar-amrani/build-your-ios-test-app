# Build your first iOS test app
This repository aims to help you get started building your first iOS app integrating Intercom iOS SDK. You'll learn how to build a simple app that allows to register/signout users as well as displaying/hiding the messenger.

## 1- Must know before writing your iOS app

While building this app, the main file that you'll be interacting with are:

- **AppDelegate.swift**: the Application Delegate is an object which receives notifications when the UIApplication object reaches certain states (App launching and teardown). For example "applicationDidFinishLaunching" function is used to handle on-startup configuration and construction and "applicationWillTerminate" function can be used to shutdown an app gracefully.
- **ViewController.swift**: the view controller manages a portion of an appâ€™s user interface as well as the interactions between that interface and the underlying data. 
- **info.plist**: Property list files are used to store user's settings (eg. permissions). They are also used to store information about bundles and applications
